# onion


A heirarchical similarity model API intended to
overlay relational data models and provide entity
recognition as well as entity resolution (provided
a sufficiently sophisticated graph of models).


Currently relies primarily on gensim similarity models
but would like to introduce other NLP models for more
fully-featured intelligent text processing.
